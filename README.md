# Metis Data Science Bootcamp Project1

For our first bootcamp project, we have a fictitious client __*WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY)*__, 
who wants to collect emails from the public so they could reach out later for fundraising and
promoting their summer gala. The company could send out a street team for email collection. 
They want us, the data scientists, to figure out how to effectively placing the street team with 
the publicly available MTA subway datasets.
